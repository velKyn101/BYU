    <h2>Kelvyn Diniz</h2>
    <p>Hello there. I'm 22 years old (at september, 19th I will be 23). I'm living in São Paulo, Brazil for the past 5 months. I moved here to work as a teacher at São Paulo's MTC. I was born and raised in a city called Curitiba. It is in the south of Brazil. Curitiba is one of the coldest cities in Brazil, so I looooove cold temperatures.</p>
    <p>My parents met the church when my mom was pregnant of me but they only got baptized when I was 2. I always had the gospel in my life and what I love the most is Jesus Christ and how we can develop a relationship with our Heavenly Father through His restored gospel.</p>
    <p>I always loved technology and it is a dream for me to work as a developer. I love creating things and turning code lines into beatiful and fancy websites looks amazing for me.</p>
    <p>Thank you for visiting my website and would love to know about you!</p>
